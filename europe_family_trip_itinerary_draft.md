## 🧭 What to Think About Next (In the Right Order)

### 🟢 Phase 1 — Lock the “Can’t-Miss” Items (High Priority)

#### 1) Hotels (most important right now)

**Why now?**
- March–April is shoulder season (good availability now)
- Prices generally rise as spring ramps up
- Location matters more than luxury for a family trip

**Order to book (highest impact first):**
1. Paris
2. Amsterdam
3. Bruges
4. Eindhoven
5. Luxembourg

**Aim for:**
- Walkable neighborhoods (reduce transit friction with a child)
- Elevator (important with luggage)
- Family room or easy twin setup

**Decision needed before booking:**
- Max nightly budget range per city
- Bed setup preference (one room vs two rooms)
- “Must-haves” (elevator, A/C, laundry, breakfast, etc.)

#### 2) Timed attractions that sell out

You don’t need every ticket now—just the critical ones.

**🔴 Book early (target: 2–3 months out):**
- Anne Frank House (Amsterdam)
- Louvre Museum (Paris)
- Palace of Versailles

**🟡 Optional / flexible:**
- Eiffel Tower (nice, but skippable if sold out)
- Musée d’Orsay (often easier to get later)

Note: Once hotels are locked, pick the timed-ticket days to match your neighborhood base and keep the “arrival day / travel day = no tickets” rule.

### 🟡 Phase 2 — Transportation Planning (plan now, buy later)

#### 3) Train strategy

Don’t buy trains yet—just lock the plan.

**Key routes:**
- Amsterdam → Eindhoven
- Eindhoven → Brussels → Bruges
- Bruges → Luxembourg
- Luxembourg → Paris

**When to buy:**
- 8–12 weeks before travel is usually the sweet spot for price + seat choice on longer legs

#### 4) Decide: seat reservations vs flexibility

- **Reserve** the long legs that require reservations (and anything you want a guaranteed seat/time for)
- **Stay flexible** on short hops (especially within the Netherlands)

### 🟢 Phase 3 — Comfort, Pace & Backup Planning

#### 5) Build “light days” (kid-friendly pacing)

- Arrival days = no timed tickets
- Travel days = no museums
- Every 2–3 “heavy” days → 1 park/free/low-stakes day

#### 6) Payments & logistics (low-stress wins)

- Wise/Revolut (optional backup)
- Notify banks of travel (if your bank still needs it)
- Apple/Google Pay confirmed and working
- Passport expiration double-check

### 🧩 Phase 4 — Optional but fun (1–2 months out)

- Canal cruise (Amsterdam or Paris)
- Seine cruise
- Chocolate workshop (Bruges)
- Guided walking tours

### ✅ What I recommend you do this week

- Decide hotel neighborhoods + max nightly budget per city
- Start watching return flight prices (Paris → Boston)
- Make a “must-see” vs “nice-to-have” list for attractions
- Add calendar reminders for the 3 critical timed-ticket items

## 📱 Train Tickets (Apps to Install)

Having these set up ahead of time makes travel days easier (and sometimes cheaper), especially for longer legs and any tickets with seat reservations.

**Netherlands (Amsterdam, Eindhoven)**
- **NS app** (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) — tickets + live platforms

**Belgium (Brussels, Bruges)**
- **SNCB/NMBS app** — tickets + schedules

**Luxembourg**
- **CFL mobile app** — schedules + tickets (note: many Luxembourg trains are free within Luxembourg, but you’ll still want the app for planning)

**France (Paris)**
- **SNCF Connect** — TGV/Intercités tickets + seat reservations when needed

**Payment setup (do this once)**
- Add your credit card to **Apple Pay** (or Google Pay)
- Make sure your bank card is enabled for **international travel / tap-to-pay**
- Optional: set up **Wise** or **Revolut** for a backup card + better FX rates

## ✈️ Return Flight Options & Cost Comparison

With this itinerary structure, **departing from Paris (CDG/ORY) is the right call**:
- Best nonstop availability to Boston
- Least stressful departure morning (no backtracking)
- Strong pricing competition due to flight volume

There’s typically **no practical benefit** to departing from Luxembourg or Brussels once you account for extra train time, connections, and the “travel day” it creates.
